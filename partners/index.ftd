-- my-ds.page: FifthTry Partners

FifthTry is building technologies like `fastn`, `hostn`, that can be used to
create websites. These technologies are designed to be really easy to use by
people at large.

Despite that sometimes you just need someone to do the work for you. Maybe you
like the benefits of `fastn` but do not have inhouse bandwidth or expertise, or
maybe you are looking to use the very best in the industry.

FifthTry is partnering with select companies to offer `fastn` community various
services. Our main focus right now is in web development and coaching /
teaching services.
