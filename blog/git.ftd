For using continuous documentation effectively you have to store your
documentation in `git`. In this blog post we will compare the documentation
workflow used when storing documentaiton in Notion/Confluence/Google Docs vs the
workflow when using Git.


-- ds.h1: Requirement Document Workflow

A typical way many product teams work is by creating requirement documents.
Depending on companies, there may be one ore more requirement documents, they
may have PRFAQ, A "One Pager", Business Requirement Document (BRD), Product
Requirement Document (PRD), Engineering Requirement Document (ERD),
["Shaped Up Document"](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) and so on.

For each logical feature, requirement, ticket, whatever goes for development,
there is a set of such documents. For a feature, there is set of requirement
document, lets call them requirement document as a whole.

Teams typically store these documents in Notion, Confluence, Google Docs and
so on. They create a new requirement document for the feature or the product
change / enhancement under consideration. This requirement document goes through
some sort of review, approval, consensus building process, and once finalied and
approved the requirement goes to engineering team for implementation.

Engineering team then further enhances the requirement documents, with
engineering considerations and those also go through a review / consensus
process.

In the end we have somehting that goes for engineering development.
