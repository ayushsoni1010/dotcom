-- ds.page: 80 char rule in text editor

80-character word wrapping is a useful practice that can improve the readability, consistency, compatibility, accessibility, formatting of written documents, and portability as it is more likely to work across editors.

We recommend `Sublime Text` text editor. Following is the step to set `80 char rule`:

- Go to `Settings` in `Preferences`
- add `"rulers": [80]`, `"word_wrap": true`

-- end: ds.page
