-- dd.presentation: Proper Authentication For FPM Controller
owner: Rithik
status: On Track

Who/what is going to be the provider? Github. One strong reason to use github,
why we can not use gmail etc is because site content would still be managed by
github.

We need to implement X-FPM-USER-ID header support. Earlier we discussed hashing
based user-id, here we will need non-hashing "original" user-id, github username
in this case.

How do we invite team mates? Github Username.

Deploy on https://hostn.io.
