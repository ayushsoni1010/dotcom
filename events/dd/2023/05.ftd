we have to change ftd.type-data.

We will have four weights specified for each "role", eg `heading-hero` will
have `light-weight`, `regular-weight`, `medium-weight` and `bold-weight`.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text: hello
role: $inherited.types.heading-hero
style: bold

-- ds.markdown:

If `style` is say `bold`, the `bold-weight` will be applied. Possible values
