-- ds.page: Feedback To Discussion

tldr: if you get a feedback from someone, create or update a thread in [our
Ideas and RFCs](https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn/discussions/categories/ideas-rfc).

-- ds.h1: Who It Applies To

This guideline is for every member of FifthTry who talks to outsiders about
what we do (doesn't everyone who works at FifthTry does that?).

This is especially important if you play a role in support, marketing,
training, development etc roles in FifthTry.

-- ds.h1: Guideline - create threads

When you talk to people about stuff we do, especially about fastn stack, they
will give pushbacks, objections, feedbacks. You are requested to create
discussion thread in [fastn discussion forum](https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn/discussions/categories/ideas-rfc).

Before creating a new thread see if any existing thread captures the same
feedback. If thread exists, add a new comment about the new source of feedback.

Upvote the feedback thread for everytime the feedback is recieved to help us
guage which feedbacks are more frequent.

-- ds.h2: Each idea should be independent

Each feedback should be independent thread.

-- ds.h1: Guideline - nurture threads

Once threads are created do share the thread with the person who gave the
feedback so they can subscribe to the thread and be notified if we have an
update.

Also share the link to feedback with the right team so they can take action.

Try to become champion of feedbacks. Adopt a feedback. See if work is happening
on the feedback. With a flurry of feedback things will start to fall through
the cracks, so keep the stuff that is important to you somewhere, and keep
coming back to it till it is resolved.

Update and curate the threads to end users can get clear understanding of
feedback.

-- ds.h1: Rationale

We at FifthTry are trying to create an open source company. More and more of our
thought process should be public. We want our decision making to happen in
public.

The most important factor that affects our decision making is feedback we get
from people who are using our products and services or are considering using
it.

As employees we will hear these feedback in all sorts of places, meetings,
random conversations etc. Based on these feedback we are updating our mental
models.

But if these feedbacks are not made publicly available, outsiders, users of our
product, potential contributors to our open source projects etc will not be
replicate those mental models, and will have a hard time understanding our
decision making process.
