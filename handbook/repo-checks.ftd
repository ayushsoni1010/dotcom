-- ds.page: Repo Checks ðŸš§

`Fifthtry` guidelines which are followed for every repository (historical or
current) in the following official `GitHub` organizations:

- fifthtry
- fastn-stack
- fastn-community

Overall goal is to create a standard for all repos that are part of `FifthTry`
as an company.

-- ds.h1: Repo Classifications

Based on the components the repo's can be classified as followings:

- [ft-code-repo](/handbook/repo-checks/#ft-code-repo)
- [ft-font-repo](/handbook/repo-checks/#ft-font-repo)
- [ft-typography-repo](/handbook/repo-checks/#ft-typography-repo)
- [typography repo](/handbook/repo-checks/#typography-repo)

-- ds.h1: Common Repo Checks

There are some common settings that each repo from all classifications and
organizations must have.

Following are the labels we add once a repo is verified.

-- ds.h2: `ft-repo-type-*`

Based on the classification of repo (repo classifications are mentioned in this
file) this `label` must be present.

-- ds.h2: `ft-verified-mar-2023`

This label will be applied to a repo if it was verified in March 2023.

-- ds.h2: `ft-main-branch-protected`

If main branch is protected.

- Require a pull request before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Require signed commits
- Do not allow bypassing the above settings
