capture product analytics from our server.

-- ds.h2: `url`

This is the URL of the request. If the activity is created out of the http
request response cycle, the URL should be constructed to represent something
meaningful. Such URLs can of this format: `__underscore__`.


-- ds.h2: `method`

The HTTP Method used for this activity. In case this is not a HTTP created
activity a suitable method should be chosen.

-- ds.h2: `ua`

The useragent that was used to create this Activity. In case of web request it
should be the UserAgent header. For a request that comes from known clients, eg
if we have an app tomorrow, or some CLI, this should represent the client, and
the version of the client.

In case of backend task, eg cron etc, this should be the script that caused the
activity, and version of the script.

-- ds.h2: `ip`

The IP address where the activity came from.

-- ds.h2: `okind`, `oid`, `ekind`, `data`

Unique identifier for the object this activity represents, and the event, and
the event related data.

The `data` must not contain user confidential information like credit card number
or password etc.


-- ds.h2: `uid`

The id of the user who triggered this activity.

-- ds.h2: `vid` and `vid_created`

The visit ID for this activity. Checkout [`visit framework`](dev/visits/) to
understand visits.

-- ds.h2: `tid`, and `tid_created`

The tracker ID for this activity. Checkout [`tracker framework`](dev/tracker/)
to understand trackers.

-- ds.h2: `when`

This is when the activity happened.

-- ds.h2: `duration`

This is the time it took for us to handle the request that this activity occured
on. In case of http request it will be time to serve the request, for cronjob
and background tasks, it will be time to handle that specific task.

-- ds.h2: `response`

In debugging mode, or for trouble shooting we may go in special mode and start
recording response in this column.

-- ds.h2: `outcome`

This is "success", "failure" or some logical thing.

-- ds.h2: `code`

This is a specific code and more uniquely identifies the specific `outcome`.

-- ds.h2: `trace`

TODO: will document this soon.

-- ds.h2: `hash`

TODO: will document this soon.

-- ds.h2: `rust_trace`

This will be renamed soon.

TODO: will document this soon.

-- ds.h2: `utm_*`

These are the utm parameters used for [tracking marketing
activities](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-use-utm-parameters/).

-- ds.h2: `site_version`

This is the version of our site that created the activity. It will mostly be the
git commit hash of the deployment.
