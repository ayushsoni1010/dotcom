-- ft.page: Updating An Already Deployed Package

To update a package, we will ask the current fpm instance to update itself. It
will create a new folder, and checkout the latest code, and try to do a git
pull on it. If it succeeds it will start serving from the new location, and
tell the controller what is the latest hash deployed.
