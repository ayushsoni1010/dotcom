-- ft.page: /get-package/ API

`/get-git/` API receieves the `ec2_reservation` or `ec2_instance_id` from the
fpm instance, and returns the zip file of the package.

This API is implemented by [`fpm controller django
service`](/dev/controller/django/).

NOTE: Shobhit will check and find out when an EC2 starts do they have access to
both `ec2_reservation` and `ec2_instance_id`, in which case, the intial null
`ec2_instance_id` column of the [`dedicated instance`
table](/dev/controller/dedicated-instances/) can also be initialised by this API.

-- ft.h1: Input: `ec2_reservation`

This is the only parameter.

-- ft.h1: Output

If the api finds a row in controller table for given ec2_reservation, it will
find the `package_id`, and then from [packages table](/dev/controller/packages/)
it will find the zip url and return it.

-- ft.code:
lang: json

{
    "success": true,
    "result": {
        "package": "<package name>"
        "git": "<git url>"
    }
}


-- ft.h1: Side Effect

This API will update the ec2_instance_id.
