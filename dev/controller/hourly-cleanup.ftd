-- ft.page: Hourly Cleanup

Every hour we will shut down all [`fpm instances`](/dev/controller/instance/)
corresponding [`plan=free` packages](/dev/controller/package/#plan) that:

- did not receive any requests in that hr
- or have exceeded their 18 hr quota

This service will run on the same machine as nginx and django, and be deployed
as cron job.

Note: Shobhit feel free to convert it to background task, but for now we are
running entire infra on one machine (other than instances).

The logic of cleanup is in the django serice, cronjob will simply call
/hourly-cleanup/ on django.

When cleaning up it will first call `/terminate/` API to django.
