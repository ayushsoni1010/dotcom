-- ft.page: Hourly Cleanup

Every hour we will shut down all [`fpm instances`](/dev/controller/instance/)
corresponding [`plan=free` packages](/dev/controller/package/#plan) that:

- did not receive any requests in that hr
- or have exceeded their 18 hr quota

This service will run on the same machine as nginx and django, and be deployed
as cron job.

Note: Shobhit feel free to convert it to background task, but for now we are
running entire infra on one machine (other than instances).

The logic of cleanup is in the django serice, cronjob will simply call
/hourly-cleanup/ on django.

When cleaning up it will first call `/terminate/` API to django.

-- ft.h1: How would we detect if a machine was idle?

1. We can ask each `fpm server` if they got any request in last 1 hrs.
2. We can also ask each fpm server to notify us if they have not received any
   request in last 1 hr.

Option 2 has an advantage that we do not need any polling.
