-- ft.page: Nginx For FPM Controller

All traffic from all domains our customers are using gets routed to this nginx.

-- ft.h1: Nginx Configuration Management

For every domain we will have a document, `/etc/nginx/<domain>.conf` file,
which will contain a forwarding rule either to [FPM
instance](/dev/controller/instance/) or the [FPM Controller django
service](/dev/controller/django/) running on localhost.
