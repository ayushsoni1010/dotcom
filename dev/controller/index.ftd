-- ds.page: FPM Controller Service

FPM Controller Machine is the entry point, all domains being served by us point
to this machine. For now we have a dedicated single instance, in future we will
make it load balanced etc.

This service runs [nginx](/dev/controller/nginx/) and
[django](/dev/controller/django/).
