-- ft.page: No Server View

Nginx sends traffic to django when there is not `fpm instance` correspnding to
any package. This django view is responsible for serving all such requests.

This view shows the info "hey we are not yet ready, this is the state". This is
like how heroku returns a non configured or server down page.

Question: Do we return 200 or 500?

This view also triggers launch of a new fpm instance corresponding to that
package if no one is looking at it.

-- ft.h1: Startup Coordination

The purpose of status column in [packages table](/dev/controller/package/) is
to ensure there is no race condition, we do not accidentally launch more than
one ec2 instance, when we are going to change the `state` from `idle` (no
instance ready) to `intialising` (setting up the instance).

The way we ensure that is by using row level locking using the `for update`
clause `SELECT` query when checking the status.

If request came to django it means there is no service. So first request will
change the status from idle to starting. Others requests will see status as
starting and will do nothing.
