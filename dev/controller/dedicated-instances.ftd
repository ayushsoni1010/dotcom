-- ft.page: Dedicated Instances Table

This table keeps track of all the FPM Service instances that are currently
running. Each instance is a ubuntu machine, which is running `fpm serve`, and
serves one fpm package.

We have decided to pick EC2 for now.

-- ft.code:
lang: py

class DedicatedInstance(models.Model):
    package = models.ForeignKey(Package, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    ec2_reservation = models.CharField(db_index=True, max_length=255)
    ec2_instance_id = models.CharField(null=True, blank=True, max_length=255)
    status = models.CharField(
        help_text="status of EC2 instance, ready, initializing, ect...",
        max_length=127,
        choices=instance_status,
    )
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

-- ft.h1: `ec2_reservation`

An instance would only be created in the table if we have gotten a EC2
reservation id, which will be stored in this field.

-- ft.h1: `ec2_instance_id`

NOTE: research EC2 API docs to see if they give us one or two ids.

-- ft.h1: `status`

The status of the instance would be store here.

-- ft.h2: `status: getting-instance`

When a row is inserted after getting the reservation id, this would be the
status.

-- ft.h2: `status: initializing`

After starting up the instance would fetch the package that they would be
serving by calling [`/get-zip/` API](/dev/controller/get-zip/). When the API
is called, the status would change from `getting-instance` to `initializing`.

-- ft.h2: `status: ready`

Once the fpm instance has download the zip and fetched its dependencies, started
the HTTP service and is ready, the instance calls `/fpm-ready/` API, which
changes the state from `initialising` to `ready`.
