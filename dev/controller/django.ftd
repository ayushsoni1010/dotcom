-- ft.page: FPM Controller DJango Service

FPM `controller` is a django service that launches [`fpm
instances`](/dev/controller/instance/).

The primary purpose of this service is to manage [nginx configuration
files](/dev/controller/nginx), and [packages](/dev/package/) and
[instances](/dev/instance/) tables. This service exposes the following APIs:

- [add-package](/dev/controller/add-package/)
- [get-package](/dev/controller/get-package/)
- [fpm-ready](/dev/controller/fpm-ready/)

It also has a special view that gets called when a request comes for a package
on free plan whose [fpm instance](/dev/controller/instance/) is shut down due
to inactivity.
