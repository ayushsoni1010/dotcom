-- ds.page: Prefer Threads


In general, when communicating on this server, especially if you are @ft-zens,
please either create a thread if you are starting a new topic, or reply in
thread if you are replying to existing discussion.

In the text file where you type, there is a (+) button on left, click on it and
you will see "create thread" option. Use it.

Use a thread-name, name should be short, to the point, and write out the message
in the message field.
