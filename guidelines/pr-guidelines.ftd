-- ds.page: Pull Request Guidelines ðŸš§

- Each `Pull Request`(PR) is a small unit of task.

- PRs must be short and specific to one task and should be merged as soon as
  possible.

- Long PRs are bad. Try to make the PRs with less lines of code. Even 100 lines
  is on the higher side.

-- ds.h1: Quick `Pull Request` merge is important

`Pull Request` context is not visible to others and if PR is left for long, it
does not fulfill it's purpose. Also, there can be conflicts in future and that
becomes tedious task.

Small PRs can be quickly reviewed and can be merged leading to a continuous
flow of updates. With each PRs that are merged are adding value to the company.


-- ds.h1: Recommendation

Each contributor should create 4-5 PRs daily. Every PR must focus on small unit
of the task.
