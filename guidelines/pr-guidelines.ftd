-- ds.page: Pull Request Guidelines ðŸš§

Each PR is a small unit of task.

PRs must be short and specific to one task and sould be merged as soon as
possible.

Long PRs are bad. Try to make the PRs with less lines of code. Even 100 lines is on the higher
side.

Why?

PR context is not visible to others, if PR is left for long, it do not fulfill
it's purpose.

There can be conflicts in future and that becomes tedious task.
