-- ds.page: Project guidelines ðŸš§

At FifthTry, we place a high value on effective communication with our partner
teams throughout the entire project lifecycle. We have established specific
guidelines and processes to deliver the projects with speed without affecting
the quality. The overall goal is to have a defined process from the start to
the delivery of the project. 


We do not believe it is a good practice to share the updates on the delivery
date. The process helps us to deliver the project while keeping our partners
informed and updated on a regular basis.To achieve this, we are following the
staged delivery where we came up with following `Priority Stages`:

- Stage 1: **Create all the URLs**
- Stage 2: **Put all the Content**
- Stage 3: **Component Structure**
- Stage 4: **Documentation**
- Stage 5: **Implementation**
- Stage 6: **Mobile Optimization**



-- ds.h1: Stage 1: Create all the URLs

In stage 1, with or without content, the team priortises on creating all the
URLs for that project. That includes creating all the pages and configuring
them using [`sitemap`](https://fastn.io/sitemap/).

The question to answer at this stage is, do we have all the URLs working for 
the project?



-- ds.h1: Stage 2: Put all the Content

At this stage, we put all the content including images for all the URLs and
verify the content is pixel to pixel matched.

We do UI review with three stages of reviews: developer review, assigned
person's review and peer review.

The question to answer is, do we have all the content for every URL created in
stage 1?

-- note.note: Note

After the Stage 2 is complete, the project is **Ready to Deploy**. We can ask
the partner teams to deploy the project and we can continue with the remaining
stages.



-- ds.h1: Stage 3: Component Structure

We create components that are used in the the project which follows the `FTD
Component Standards`.


-- ds.h1: Stage 4: Documentation

At this stage, we aim to complete the documentation which itself follows the
`FTD Documentation Standards`.


-- ds.h1: Stage 5: Implementation

In this stage, specific to Desktop version, we inspect it everything has been
implemented as required.


-- ds.h1: Stage 6: Mobile Optimization

It is not a rule that mobile optimization cannot be done in previous stages,
but this stage verifies and answers the question, is the mobile optimization 
ready and working properly?


These stages not only help us to deliver the project with accuracy but with
conviction that we have followed a process and the partner teams get to see
entire project lifecycle.


Our commitment to open and transparent communication is an essential component
of our overall approach to project management and delivery.
